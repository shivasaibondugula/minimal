You are required to model to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc. It should also be used to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.

## Machine learning (Ridge and Lasso regression)

### House-price-prediction 

<center><img src="images/house_price_prediction.png"/></center>

You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein you have to build a Ridge and Lasso regression models for the prediction of house prices based on available independent variables.

This Model will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
